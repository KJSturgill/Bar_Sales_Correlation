For that reason I will leave out the comparison of kareoke nights, as theres no visable correlation, atleast with the mock data, between kareoke and types of drink.

Knowing the correlation between whats happneing and what drinks sell is important for ordering supplies, and knowing that these 2 events dont stray much from the average of drinks lets us know to order the average ammount."
